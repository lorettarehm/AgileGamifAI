# Security Policy

## API Key Security

### Current Implementation

**SECURITY IMPROVEMENT**: AgileGamifAI now implements a secure serverless architecture where API keys are protected server-side.

### Secure Architecture

✅ **Implemented**: The application now uses serverless functions to proxy LLM API calls:

```
Client → Serverless Function → LLM Service
```

- **API keys are secure**: HuggingFace API keys are kept server-side only
- **No client-side exposure**: API keys are never exposed in the built JavaScript bundle
- **Serverless functions**: Netlify Functions handle LLM API calls securely
- **Client calls secure endpoints**: Frontend makes requests to authenticated serverless functions

### Security Measures

1. **Serverless Function Encapsulation**: All LLM API calls are handled by secure serverless functions
2. **Server-side API Keys**: API keys are stored as server-side environment variables only
3. **Runtime Validation**: API keys are validated server-side before use
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
5. **CORS Protection**: Proper CORS headers for secure cross-origin requests

### Legacy Architecture (Deprecated)

The following approaches were previously documented but are **no longer needed** as the security issue has been resolved:

~~#### 1. Backend API~~
~~#### 2. Serverless Functions~~ ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
~~#### 3. User-Based API Keys~~

**Current Status**: ✅ **SECURE** - The application now implements secure serverless functions, eliminating API key exposure.

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

#### Client-side (Vite)
```bash
# Database credentials (safe for client-side use with row-level security)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

#### Server-side (Netlify Functions)
```bash
# LLM API Key (secure server-side only)
HF_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
```

**✅ Security Improvement**: API keys are now properly secured server-side and never exposed to end users.

### Deployment Configuration

#### Netlify Deployment

1. **Set Environment Variables**: In Netlify UI, set the server-side environment variable:
   - `HF_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_huggingface_access_token`

2. **Automatic Deployment**: The application automatically deploys with secure serverless functions

3. **Function Endpoints**: The following endpoints will be available:
   - `/.netlify/functions/generateGameData` - For AI-assisted game completion
   - `/.netlify/functions/generateCompleteGame` - For full game generation

#### Local Development

For local development with Netlify CLI:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Set local environment variable
netlify env:set HF_ACCESS_TOKEN your_huggingface_access_token

# Run local development server with functions
netlify dev
```

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Zero API Key Exposure**: API keys never appear in client-side code or browser
2. **Rate Limiting**: Can be implemented at the function level
3. **Authentication**: Functions can implement additional authentication if needed
4. **Monitoring**: Server-side logging and monitoring of API usage
5. **Cost Control**: Centralized API usage tracking and controls

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the maintainers rather than opening a public issue.
