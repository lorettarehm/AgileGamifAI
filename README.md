- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Get game recommendations based on your team's specific needs and challenges
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Generate complete game structures in seconds, then refine with human expertise
- **Smart Filtering**: Find the perfect game by methodology, team size, duration, complexity, and learning objectives
- **Accessibility First**: Games designed with inclusivity in mind, featuring accessibility notes and adaptations
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Detailed facilitation instructions
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Facilitate from any device, anywhere
- **Favorites System**: Save and organize your most effective games

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (use `.env.example` as a template):

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anonymous_key
VITE_HF_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_huggingface_access_token
```

**⚠️ Security Note**: This application requires an API key for AI features. In client-side applications like this, API keys in environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed in the built bundle. For production use, consider implementing a backend API or serverless functions to securely handle LLM calls.

### User-Provided API Keys Option

For production deployments, you can configure the application to let users provide their own HuggingFace API keys instead of using a shared key:

**When to Use This Approach**:
- ✅ Production deployments where you want to avoid exposing shared API keys
- ✅ When users should control their own AI usage and costs
- ✅ Educational or enterprise environments where users have their own HuggingFace accounts
- ✅ When you want to scale AI features without managing centralized API costs

**How It Works**:
- Users enter their personal HuggingFace API key through the application interface
- Keys are stored securely in the user's browser localStorage
- Each user is responsible for their own API usage and billing
- AI features work seamlessly once a valid key is provided

**Getting Started with User Keys**:
1. Users sign up for a free HuggingFace account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
2. Generate an API key from their HuggingFace settings
3. Enter the key in the application when prompted
4. Start using AI-powered game generation features

**Important Considerations**:
- Users are responsible for API costs and key security
- Keys should be rotated regularly for security
- See our detailed [Security Documentation](SECURITY.md#user-provided-api-keys) for complete implementation guidance

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
